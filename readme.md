# H1 Welcome to Daisyui-Native

Think of this UI library as if daisyui styles and radix component customizability

*Note: This is a work in progress. Theme customizability and the styling on certain components are odd but will be updated in the future*


## H2 How it works

1. Clone this project

`git clone "https://github.com/XDagging/daisyui-native.git"`

2. Install all local dependencies

`npm install`

3. Run the expo server

`npx expo start`


and... you're all set.


Comes with Nativewind natively as well :)

**A couple of considerations:**

- Themes are hardcoded in some places. If you want to change the theme, you should change the LightTheme in themes.ts as well the LightTheme in the `tailwind.config.js` file. (This will be fixed in a later push)

- Yes. The Input component looks terrible. Will be fixed

- Feel free to contribute if you want

**Future Roadmap**

1) Add CLI to add component one by one (similar to shadcn)

2) Make themes wayy easier to customize

3) Overall way clearer documentation
